Does a college degree equally benefit every graduate in terms of earnings? Many 
individuals invest thousands of dollars each year to pursue a bachelor’s degree; however, a 
college degree does not always guarantee a decent salary for all graduates despite the steep 
cost of tuition. The labour market outcomes are ideal for some people while much worse for 
others. Although this disparity can be affected by factors such as innate abilities and family 
backgrounds, fields of study, as the most intuitive horizontal stratification for college students, 
may play an essential role in determining earnings inequality among college graduates.
When discussing educational attainment and wage inequality, most research often 
focuses on the effect of the highest level of education while neglecting the differences in 
degrees in various fields. In the twenty-first century, as opposed to the period before 2000, 
the growing returns to college degrees now account for a significantly smaller portion of 
wage variation; the primary contributor to the increased wage disparity lies in the growing 
inequality among individuals with college degrees (Autor, Goldin, and Katz 2020). This 
implies that the wage gap between bachelor’s degree holders and high school graduates is 
still valid, of course, but other dimensions of education that help explain the wage inequality 
among college graduates can become increasingly crucial.
To explore the impact of fields of study on the earnings gap, this dissertation will 
utilize the US National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) in 2019 and perform OLS 
regression to draw inferences on the magnitude of impact on annual salary by fields of study
of bachelor’s degree. The NSCG public use microdata contains demographic and family 
background information (e.g., parent's education level), which are appropriate to include in 
the model as control variables. First, I picture the overall effect of fields of study on annual 
salary under different sets of covariates; second, I compare the impact on earnings across 
fields of study within gender and investigate the interaction effects of gender and fields of 
study on earnings.
The findings reveal that certain traditional STEM majors, such as engineering and 
computer science, tend to remarkably boost earnings in comparison to other STEM majors,
such as biology. Non-STEM fields, except for management, are likely to yield adverse effects. 
A degree in education demonstrates the most significant negative impact on earnings
regardless of gender. Furthermore, females benefit more from a degree in engineering, and
there is almost no gender pay gap on average for engineering degree holders. In contrast,
females with degrees in female-dominated fields like education and health are relatively 
disadvantaged in earnings.
This empirical study aims to facilitate a better understanding of wage inequality 
among college graduates. However, the significance of this study is not to suggest that 
choosing specific majors may be superior to choosing others under high salary expectations. 
Instead, it aims to emphasize the importance of adapting college education to meet the 
evolving demand for skills and pay more attention to the employment outcome of college 
graduates. This is particularly important for fields that tend to be disadvantaged in terms of 
earnings. Besides, it is crucial to account for gender differentials when designing policies. 
Other than keeping up with the positive outcomes, such as promoting women's involvement 
in engineering, it is equally important to understand and address the challenges women face 
in female-dominated fields like education.
